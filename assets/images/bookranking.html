<h1>The Best Books According To Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 book series of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<p><h3>Six of Crows<br /></h3>
   What can I say? Everything about this book is perfect. The characters, the plot, the worldbuilding... Plus there are multiples POVs, making the stories richer overall!</p>
<p><h3>Percy Jackson<br /></h3>
   The author's writing style is really enjoyable for me. He uses a bunch of Internet references, and not to mention the amount of comedy breaks he puts, everything about this series is amazing.</p>
<p><h3>Harry Potter</h3>
   This series is enchanting. Every adventure Harry takes makes me feel like I am in that world. The characters feel real and I feel unreal whenever I am on that adventure.</p>
